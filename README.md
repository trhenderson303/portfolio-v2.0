## Description
This second iteration of my professional portfolio uses a variety of new technologies to showcase the new skills and various projects I have developed over the course of a full-stack bootcamp. The application is built using ReactJS and incorporates various libraries, such as Framer Motion and GranimJS, as well as the Material UI framework. In this portfolio refresh, I strove to build a product that represents my taste for simple, stylish UI design that is friendly to all screens!
